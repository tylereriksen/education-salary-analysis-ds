    "Undergraduate college students feel the desperate need to apply to graduate school in order to earn their degree, increasing their chances of securing a full time job with a desired pay. Especially in regards to the increase in housing after the pandemic and lay-offs in high technology companies, a satisfactory pay is crucial to obtain a comfortable living standard. However, our group seeks out the question of *is the relationship between the level of educational degree and income in the U.S. significant even after regarding the external factors such as race, gender, and age?* Are there other factors as crucial as a degree that can obtain financial security? After cleaning and analyzing the couple datasets, we found a statistical significance between the level of educational degree and income despite the contribution of race, age, and gender."

    "The interplay between education and economic outcomes has been extensively studied, underscoring the value of education as a determinant of earnings. In the 1970s, Jacob Mincer established a model demonstrating that educational attainment and work experience are pivotal in predicting income levels. This foundational model has been crucial for subsequent research into human capital and wages, highlighting education's role in shaping economic prospects.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the influence of education on earnings is not singular nor the most decisive across all demographics. Recent studies have begun to compare the relative impact of educational degrees with other factors such as work experience, race, and sex on an individual's income in the U.S. For example, disparities in earnings that arise from racial and gender differences have been observed even when educational attainment is controlled for, suggesting that while education is a significant factor, it is part of a complex interplay of variables influencing economic success.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nuanced understanding of education's economic return has been further elaborated in discussions by scholars and in platforms such as the World Bank Blogs, which examine the varying economic returns on education across different countries and demographic groups. These explorations underscore that education's value cannot be fully understood without considering the intersectionality of race and sex, which can both independently and collectively affect income.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comprehensive analysis by Anna Bernasek in The New York Times provides insight into the American education system's economic landscape. Bernasek's work points to the multifaceted nature of education's economic benefits and the challenges of measuring its impact due to intersecting factors such as race and sex, alongside the direct economic outcomes like income and productivity. Furthermore, she emphasizes that societal impacts, such as civic understanding and the generation of innovative ideas, are also essential dimensions of education's value, which may interact with these factors in complex ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this body of research evolves, it is becoming increasingly clear that to fully understand the determinants of income in the U.S., a comprehensive approach that considers educational degrees in conjunction with work experience, race, and sex is essential. This perspective is crucial for policymakers and educators aiming to leverage education as a tool for economic empowerment across diverse contexts.\n",

The categorical variable is shown in increasing order of educational degree levels, from less than high school to post bachelor's degree, and we see that the average income wage is monotonically increasing over it. This suggests the correlation between education degree and average income wage.\n",

We will compare race, age, and gender with income, and if there are any discrepancies -- an evident contrast - we can first conclude that an external factor can effect one's wage. Then, we can procede to see if its effect is siginificant enough to skew the direct correlation between education degree and average income wage.\n",

    "There are certain privacy and ethics considerations that we will have to take into account for our project. Given that we plan to examine income levels, there is a risk of exposing sensitive financial information. To mitigate this, we commit to anonymizing the data, replacing personally identifiable information with unique identifiers to safeguard the privacy of participants. Moreover, we recognize the importance of exploring potential biases in our dataset. There could be biases related to the demographics of the sample, potentially excluding certain populations and impacting the equitable analysis of our findings. To address this, we will conduct thorough exploratory data analysis to identify any disparities in representation. During the analysis phase, we will implement appropriate statistical techniques to control for biases and ensure that our results provide a fair and comprehensive assessment. We will adhere to ethical standards, seeking to minimize the potential negative impact of our study on privacy and promoting equitable outcomes."

    "# Discussion and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In our data science project, we conducted a rigorous analysis of the 'cps18.csv' dataset, focusing on the relationships between education level, demographic factors, and income. The project began with a thorough data cleaning process, setting a high standard for data integrity and relevance. This foundational step included the creation of one-hot encoding for education levels and the transformation of categorical race data into dummy variables, which was crucial for our subsequent analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant aspect of our project was the use of advanced statistical techniques to explore and quantify these relationships. We conducted t-tests to examine differences in average ages between groups with varying education levels, uncovering significant distinctions that highlight the importance of education in income potential and career advancement. Additionally, our regression models were particularly insightful, revealing the strong impact of higher education on income wages despite external factors. This core finding underscores the value of educational attainment and its direct correlation with economic outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, our project effectively utilized visual tools to illustrate the distribution of income across different demographic groups. These visualizations brought to light sharp contrasts and provided an accessible way for viewers to engage with our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, our study is not without limitations. The cross-sectional nature of the dataset limits our ability to infer causality. Future research could explore these relationships longitudinally to understand the evolving impact of education and demographic changes on income over time. Additionally, incorporating variables like employment sector, geographical factors, and job experience would offer a more comprehensive view of the income dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, our project leverages data science methodologies to elucidate the intricate connections between education, demographic characteristics, and income. The insights we have gleaned are not only academically significant but also carry profound implications for policymakers and educators. They highlight the need for policies that promote equitable access to education, thereby bridging income disparities. Our analysis serves as a robust model for similar studies and sets the stage for more expansive research in this field.\n",
