## A Data Science Project
This is me and my group's COGS 108 Data Science in Practice final project. We aim to answer "Is the relationship between the level of educational degree and income in the U.S. significant even after regarding the external factors such as race, gender, and age?" The final report and results can be viewed [here](FinalProject_Group137_WI24.ipynb).
